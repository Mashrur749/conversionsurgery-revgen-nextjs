# QA Checklist

## 01-admin-schema-auth

### Schema Verification
- [ ] `users` table has `is_admin` boolean column (default: false)
- [ ] `users` table has `client_id` FK referencing `clients.id`
- [ ] `accounts` table has unique constraint on `(provider, provider_account_id)`
- [ ] `sessions` table has `session_token` unique constraint
- [ ] `verification_tokens` table has composite PK on `(identifier, token)`
- [ ] All auth tables use `uuid` primary keys

### Auth Type Declarations
- [ ] `Session.user` includes `isAdmin?: boolean`
- [ ] `Session.client?` includes `id`, `businessName`, `ownerName`
- [ ] `User` interface includes `isAdmin?: boolean`

### signIn Callback
- [ ] Non-admin user without matching client email is denied sign-in
- [ ] Admin user can always sign in (even without client)
- [ ] User with matching client email is allowed sign-in
- [ ] User auto-linked to client on first sign-in when `clientId` is null

### Session Callback
- [ ] `session.user.isAdmin` is populated from DB
- [ ] Non-admin user with `clientId` gets `session.client` populated
- [ ] Admin user does NOT get `session.client` populated
- [ ] `session.user.id` is set from DB user ID

### Manual Verification Steps
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000/login`
3. Sign in with admin email (must have `is_admin = true` in DB)
4. Open browser console and run:
   ```js
   fetch('/api/auth/session').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
   ```
5. Verify response includes `user.isAdmin: true`
6. Sign out and sign in with a client email
7. Verify response includes `client.id`, `client.businessName`, `client.ownerName`
8. Attempt sign-in with an email not in clients table — should be denied

### Build Verification
- [ ] `npm run build` completes with 0 TypeScript errors
- [ ] All auth routes registered: `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`

## 02-admin-ui-components

### File Existence
- [ ] `src/components/ui/select.tsx` exists (shadcn Select component)
- [ ] `src/lib/admin-context.tsx` exists (AdminProvider + useAdmin hook)
- [ ] `src/components/providers.tsx` wraps children with `AdminProvider`
- [ ] `src/components/admin/client-selector.tsx` exists (shadcn-based selector)
- [ ] `src/lib/get-client-id.ts` exists (server-side helper)
- [ ] `src/lib/hooks/use-client-id.ts` exists (client-side hook)

### Admin Context (src/lib/admin-context.tsx)
- [ ] `AdminProvider` persists `selectedClientId` to `localStorage`
- [ ] `AdminProvider` syncs `selectedClientId` to a cookie (`adminSelectedClientId`)
- [ ] `AdminProvider` restores `selectedClientId` from `localStorage` on mount
- [ ] `setSelectedClientId(null)` clears both `localStorage` and cookie
- [ ] `selectedClient` is derived from `clients` array when `selectedClientId` changes
- [ ] `isLoading` starts `true` and becomes `false` after hydration
- [ ] `useAdmin()` throws if used outside `AdminProvider`

### Providers (src/components/providers.tsx)
- [ ] `SessionProvider` wraps `AdminProvider` (session available inside admin context)
- [ ] Both providers are `'use client'` components

### Client Selector (src/components/admin/client-selector.tsx)
- [ ] Renders an "Admin" badge with amber styling
- [ ] Renders a shadcn `Select` dropdown with client business names
- [ ] Selecting a client updates `AdminContext` (and persists to localStorage/cookie)
- [ ] If no client is selected and clients exist, auto-selects the first client
- [ ] Accepts `clients` as a prop (server-fetched data passed down)

### Server-Side Client ID (src/lib/get-client-id.ts)
- [ ] Returns `null` if no session
- [ ] For admin users: reads `adminSelectedClientId` cookie and returns it
- [ ] For non-admin users: returns `session.client.id`
- [ ] Uses `await cookies()` (Next.js 15+ async API)

### Client-Side Hook (src/lib/hooks/use-client-id.ts)
- [ ] For admin users: returns `selectedClientId` from `AdminContext`
- [ ] For non-admin users: returns `session.client.id`
- [ ] Returns `null` if no session

### Manual Verification Steps
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Sign in as admin user
3. Open browser console and verify `localStorage.getItem('adminSelectedClientId')` returns a client ID
4. Check that the `adminSelectedClientId` cookie is set (DevTools > Application > Cookies)
5. Refresh the page — the selected client should persist (not reset)
6. Change client selection in the dropdown — verify localStorage and cookie both update
7. Clear selection — verify localStorage and cookie are removed

### Build Verification
- [ ] `npm run build` completes with 0 TypeScript errors
- [ ] No new warnings related to admin-context or client-selector
