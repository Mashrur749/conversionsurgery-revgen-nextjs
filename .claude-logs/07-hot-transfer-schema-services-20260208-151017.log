All done. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

### 07-hot-transfer-schema-services — Complete

**Steps 1 & 2 (Schema + Business Hours Service)** — Already existed from prior sessions:
- `src/db/schema/business-hours.ts` — business_hours table with unique index
- `src/db/schema/call-attempts.ts` — call_attempts table with 3 indexes
- `src/db/schema/relations.ts` — businessHoursRelations + callAttemptsRelations
- `src/lib/services/business-hours.ts` — 4 functions (initialize, isWithin, get, update)

**Step 3** — Hot intent detection added to `src/lib/services/openai.ts`:
- `detectHotIntent(message)` — matches 16 trigger phrases case-insensitively
- Commit: `ee9cce1`

**Step 4** — Ring group service created at `src/lib/services/ring-group.ts`:
- `initiateRingGroup()` — queries hot-transfer team members, creates call attempt, initiates Twilio call, notifies team via SMS
- `handleNoAnswer()` — notifies team of missed transfer, sends apology to lead, flags lead as action required
- Adapted to use `getDb()` per-request pattern (not cached `db`)
- Commit: `d4cae57`

**Build**: 0 TypeScript errors, compiled successfully

**QA Checklist**: 88 lines of test steps appended covering schemas, services, hot intent detection, ring group, and manual verification steps. Commit: `f6c8cd7`
