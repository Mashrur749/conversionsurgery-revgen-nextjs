All done. Here's the summary:

## 12-phone-number-ui Implementation Complete

### What was done:
Most of the Phase 11b files already existed from a previous session. The key change was:

1. **Step 1 (page.tsx)** — Already matched doc spec (with correct `getDb()` and `Promise<{ id: string }>` patterns). No changes needed.

2. **Step 2 (phone-number-manager.tsx)** — Upgraded from custom tab buttons to shadcn `Tabs`/`TabsList`/`TabsTrigger`/`TabsContent` components as specified in the doc. Commit: `fe77bd9`

3. **Step 3 (twilio/page.tsx)** — Already matched doc spec with proper `getDb()` pattern. No changes needed.

4. **Step 4 (layout.tsx)** — Navigation already includes `/admin/twilio` and `/admin/phone-numbers` routes in grouped admin nav. No changes needed.

5. **Build** — Passes with 0 TypeScript errors.

6. **QA-CHECKLIST.md** — Appended comprehensive QA test steps covering all 5 sections (page, tabs, current/search/existing tabs, Twilio account page, navigation) plus manual verification steps and build checks. Commit: `a51e38b`
