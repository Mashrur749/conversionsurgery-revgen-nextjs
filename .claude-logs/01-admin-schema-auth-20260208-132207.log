All done. Here's the summary:

## 01-admin-schema-auth: Already Implemented

All 5 steps from the doc were already present in the codebase:

| Step | File | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 1. Schema (`isAdmin`, auth tables) | `src/db/schema/auth.ts` | Already exists |
| 2. Push schema | Database | Already applied |
| 3. Auth types | `src/types/next-auth.d.ts` | Already exists |
| 4. Auth config (signIn/session callbacks) | `src/lib/auth-options.ts` | Already exists |
| 5. Set admin user | SQL manual step | Your responsibility |

**Note on Step 5**: Run this in your Neon console to set yourself as admin:
```sql
UPDATE users SET is_admin = true WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

**Commit**: `4d0a1db` — Created `QA-CHECKLIST.md` with verification steps for this phase. Build passes with 0 TypeScript errors.
