All done. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

### 04-team-schema-service Implementation

**Step 1 — Schema tables** (`aedc042`): Verified `team_members` and `escalation_claims` tables already exist with all required columns, indexes, and relations matching the spec.

**Step 2 — Token utility** (`aee998f`): Verified `src/lib/utils/tokens.ts` with `generateClaimToken()` already exists matching the spec.

**Step 3 — Team escalation service** (`fd05e70`): Enhanced `src/lib/services/team-escalation.ts` with:
- Email notifications via `actionRequiredEmail` for members with email
- `orderBy(priority)` for team member selection
- `claimEscalation` now clears `actionRequired`/`actionRequiredReason` on the lead
- `claimEscalation` notifies other team members via SMS when someone claims
- `claimEscalation` returns claimer name when already claimed
- `claimEscalation` returns `leadPhone` on success

**Step 4 — QA checklist** (`a44dd49`): Appended comprehensive QA test steps covering schema, token utility, and all 3 service functions.

**Build**: 0 TypeScript errors.
