Everything is already fully implemented. Here's the summary:

**All 6 steps from `17-crm-conversations.md` are already complete:**

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Add conversation mode columns to leads schema | Done (`b1a648d`) |
| 2 | Create conversations list page | Done (`6586d31`) |
| 3 | Create conversation detail page | Done (`934afa6`) |
| 4 | Create conversation view component | Done (`7edc9e4`) |
| 5 | Create takeover, handback, send API routes | Done (`75f2323`) |
| 6 | Update incoming SMS handler for human mode | Done (`a687903`) |
| QA | Append QA test steps to QA-CHECKLIST.md | Done (`4950c75`) |

The build passes with 0 errors, all routes (`/client/conversations`, `/client/conversations/[id]`, API routes) are registered, and TypeScript strict mode errors were fixed in `b70b9ef`. Nothing left to do.
