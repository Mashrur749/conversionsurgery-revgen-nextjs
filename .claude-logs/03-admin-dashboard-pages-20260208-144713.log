### Key adaptations from the doc
- Used `getDb()` from `@/db` instead of `db` from `@/lib/db`
- Kept existing `SignOutButton` client component instead of server action `signOut`
- Kept `AdminProvider` wrapper in layout
- Preserved existing admin nav groups (Management, Optimization, Configuration) with amber styling
- All pages now use `getClientId()` for unified admin/client resolution via cookie
