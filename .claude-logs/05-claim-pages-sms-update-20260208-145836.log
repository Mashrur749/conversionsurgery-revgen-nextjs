### Files Created (4)
- `src/app/api/claim/route.ts` - POST endpoint with Zod validation, delegates to `claimEscalation()`
- `src/app/(auth)/claim/page.tsx` - Server component that looks up escalation by token, shows lead info + team member list
- `src/app/(auth)/claim/claim-form.tsx` - Client component with Select dropdown and claim button
- `src/app/(auth)/claim-error/page.tsx` - Error page for invalid/expired/already-claimed links

### Files Modified (2)
- `src/lib/automations/incoming-sms.ts` - Added team escalation via `notifyTeamForEscalation()`, contractor fallback notifications (SMS + email), activity notifications, and 20-message history limit
- `QA-CHECKLIST.md` - Added 69 lines of QA test steps

### Key Adaptations from Doc
- Used `getDb()` + `@/db` imports (project pattern) instead of `db` + `@/lib/db`
- Used `Promise<>` wrapper for `searchParams` (Next.js 16 async params)
- Added type assertion for `fetch().json()` response to satisfy strict TypeScript
- Build: **0 TypeScript errors**, all 3 new routes registered (`/claim`, `/claim-error`, `/api/claim`)
