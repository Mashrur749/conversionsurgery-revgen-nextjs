### Files Created (5):
- `src/lib/services/lead-scoring.ts` — scoring engine (quick/AI/batch)
- `src/app/api/leads/[id]/score/route.ts` — individual lead scoring API
- `src/app/api/clients/[id]/leads/scores/route.ts` — client score distribution API
- `src/components/leads/lead-score-badge.tsx` — temperature badge component
- `src/components/leads/lead-score-distribution.tsx` — distribution chart

### Files Modified (4):

- `src/lib/automations/incoming-sms.ts` — scoring on inbound SMS
- `src/app/(dashboard)/leads/page.tsx` — score badge in leads list

### Key Adaptations from Doc:
- Used `getDb()` per-request pattern instead of `db` import
- Used `conversations` table instead of `messages`
- Used `clients.status = 'active'` instead of `clients.isActive`
- Used `Promise<{ id: string }>` for Next.js 16 async params
- Added type assertions for `.catch(() => ({}))` to fix TypeScript
- Integrated with actual webhook handler at `incoming-sms.ts`
- Installed `tooltip` shadcn component (was missing)

### Build: 0 TypeScript errors
