All done. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

### 5 commits for Phase 8c: Team Members UI

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `811f3b6` | Step 1: Updated team members API with `getClientId()` for client-side access + phone normalization |
| `5e0e435` | Step 2: Created `src/app/api/team-members/[id]/route.ts` with PATCH and DELETE handlers |
| `0bffc14` | Step 3: Created `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/team-members-list.tsx` component |
| `63bba46` | Step 4: Added Team Members card section to settings page |
| `f58fa35` | Appended QA test steps to `QA-CHECKLIST.md` |

### Key adaptations from the doc to match codebase patterns:
- Used `getDb()` instead of `import { db }` 
- Used `@/db/schema` instead of `@/lib/db/schema`
- Used Next.js 16 async params (`Promise<{ id: string }>` with `await params`)
- Added typed fetch responses to satisfy strict TypeScript
- Preserved backward-compatible response keys (`teamMembers` + `members`) so the existing admin `TeamManager` component continues working
- Build: **0 TypeScript errors**
